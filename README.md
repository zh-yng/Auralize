# Auralize

> Auralize transforms every smartphone into part of a synchronized light show, creating instant community at any event without expensive hardware. A host generates a 4-digit code, friends join instantly, and phones sync in real time to effects like Twinkle or Ripple using GPS-driven wave simulations. 
> Built with React Native + Expo for seamless cross-platform usability and Firebase for lightweight authentication and real-time sync, Auralize is fast, intuitive, and scalable from 4 to 40,000 users. Its polished interface makes effects easy to launch while keeping the experience immersive and aesthetic. Unlike disposable LED wristbands, Auralize is free, customizable, and universally accessible, redefining audience engagement.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
